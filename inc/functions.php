        Motivated by the warm fall weather we\'ve been having, I decided to toss together a bunch of my favorite veggies and deck them out in a dressing
        that is as blissful as it is tasty.  With some brief chopping and processing, I had the above whipped up in just 20 minutes.  Better yet,
        I stored the leftover chopped ingredients in containers so that I could put this special salad together in the blink of an eye throughout the week.'],
